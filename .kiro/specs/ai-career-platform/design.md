# Design Document

## Overview

The AI Career Platform is designed as a lightweight, demo-ready web application with a modular architecture supporting students, employers, and placement officers. The system leverages free AI APIs for natural language processing and recommendation algorithms, implements a responsive blue-grey themed interface, and provides core functionality without heavy computational requirements.

### 2. AI Recommendation Engine

**Career Recommendation Service:**
```python
class CareerRecommendationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.skill_career_mapping = {}
        self.ai_client = HuggingFaceClient()
    
    def generate_recommendations(self, student_profile):
        # Use free AI API for text analysis
        skills_analysis = self.ai_client.analyze_skills(student_profile.skills)
        academic_analysis = self.ai_client.analyze_academics(student_profile.academics)
        
        # Combine with rule-based matching
        career_matches = self.match_careers(skills_analysis, academic_analysis)
        return self.rank_recommendations(career_matches)
```

**Job Matching Algorithm:**
```python
class JobMatchingService:
    def match_candidates(self, job_requirements, candidate_pool):
        # Use semantic similarity via free APIs
        job_embedding = self.get_text_embedding(job_requirements)
        
        matches = []
        for candidate in candidate_pool:
            candidate_embedding = self.get_text_embedding(candidate.profile_text)
            similarity_score = self.calculate_similarity(job_embedding, candidate_embedding)
            matches.append((candidate, similarity_score))
        
        return sorted(matches, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

### 3. Analytics and Reporting Component

**Dashboard Widgets:**
- Skill gap heatmaps by department
- Placement trend line charts
- Industry demand pie charts
- Real-time statistics counters

**Export Functionality:**
- PDF report generation using ReportLab
- CSV data export for Excel compatibility
- Scheduled report delivery via email
